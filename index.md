## Probable Futures Open Data Documentation

[Probable Futures](https://probablefutures.org/) resources, data, and maps enable anyone to build climate literacy. Building climate literacy empowers individuals and organizations to understand how the Earth’s climate system works, recognize the ways in which it underpins our society, and identify opportunities to address the challenges and opportunities that climate change presents.

A foundation of climate literacy is critical to:
– understand your climate risk
– make informed decisions
– take appropriate actions
– mitigate the impacts of climate change
– contribute to a more resilient future

Living well in a changing climate depends on climate literacy. 

The data and maps described in this documentation offer specific, global-to-local insight into climate conditions across six different climate scenarios, including the past, near-present, future, and potential-future. 

This documentation is intended for data-savvy people, including but not limited to analysts, data scientists, and software engineers, who are interested in exploring or building applications with Probable Futures maps and data. The resources described in this documentation includes the Probable Futures maps, tilesets, APIs, raw data, and more.

### Prerequisite

We strongly recommend reading, or listening to the audio version of, the Probable Futures [climate handbook](https://probablefutures.org/climate-handbook). The handbook provides essential context for using and interpreting the maps and data described in this documentation.
