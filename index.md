# Probable Futures Open Data Documentation

Welcome to the [Probable Futures](https://probablefutures.org/) open data documentation. The tools, data, and maps described here enable anyone to foster climate literacy using vetted and tested open-source climate data and maps. To begin using these resources, [sign up](https://airtable.com/app5vySCXl6f2s8zB/shrOMfMgh7EoHajKN). 

### Why climate literacy
Building climate literacy empowers individuals and organizations to understand how the Earthâ€™s climate system works, recognize the ways in which it underpins our society, and identify opportunities to address the challenges and opportunities that climate change presents.

A foundation of climate literacy is critical to:
- understand your climate risk
- make informed decisions
- take appropriate actions
- mitigate the impacts of climate change
- contribute to a more resilient future

Living well in a changing climate depends on climate literacy. 

### What this is and who it is for 

The data and maps described in this documentation offer specific, global-to-local insight into climate conditions across six different climate scenarios, including the past, near-present, future, and potential-future. 

This documentation is intended for data-savvy people who are interested in exploring or building applications with Probable Futures maps and data, including but not limited to analysts, data scientists, and software engineers. The resources described in this documentation include the Probable Futures maps, APIs, raw data, and more.

### Pre-reading

The Probable Futures [climate handbook](https://probablefutures.org/climate-handbook) takes you from the climate stability of the past, through the changes we are experiencing today, and into our probable futures. It is available as a multimedia reading experience or in audio form. It provides essential context for using and interpreting the maps and data described in this documentation.
