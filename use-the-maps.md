## Maps API

This section is for developers who want to integrate the Probable Futures maps into their own websites or applications. It is possible to achieve this in three ways:

1. Download an embeddable map, for example to display a map in an article
2. Use the embeddable maps package to integrate the maps into your own application, for example if your app requires more dynamic interaction
3. Restyle the maps and host them with your own Mapbox account, for example if you would like to use different colors or bins on the maps
